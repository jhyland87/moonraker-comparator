# Moonraker Comparator

## _WORK IN PROGRESS_

## Summary
This plugin is meant to add resources that can be used to compare the slicer settings used to generate two gcode files, and is basically a simple evolution of the [gcode_slicer_diff](https://github.com/jhyland87/gcode_slicer_diff) script I wrote, but with some very notable changes.

1. Written to be integrated into Moonraker as a simple plugin.
2. Saves the processed slicer settings to the metadata object, making viewing/comparing them in the future much easier and quicker.
3. Ability to process gcode generated by other slicers other than just PrusaSlicer.
4. Settings for  _config key aliases_ and _alias_modifiers_ which make it possible to compare similar values that are used by different slicers.
	- Example: PrusaSlicer has a `elefant_foot_compensation` option for dealing with the elephants foot which takes a positive value. In Cura, this can be done with the `xy_offset_layer_0` setting which would require a negative value. Thus, comparing the two would require inverting the numerical value.
